								<h3>Location</h3>
							</header>
							<p>Located in southeast queens, JFK is about 45 minutes away from midtown manhattan by car. During rush hours it can take as long as 1.5 hours. However you can reach manhattan by either the subway or the Long Island Railroad. JFK is far for people from jersey and other west of the hudson but is much more ideal for people who live in westchester, manhattan, queens, brooklyn, the bronx and the western counties of long island.</p>

								<h3>Layout</h3>
							</header>
							<p>JFK currently has 6 terminals, 1,2,4,5,7, and 8. Each terminal varies in size some containing as little as 10 gates and other having upwards of 48. Terminal 1 is a primary international terminal with airlines including Japan Airlines and Air France. It is relatively small and each gate is within walking distance. Terminal 2 is a delta domestic terminal. The terminal is small which means security is quickre but the terminal is very old and decrepit. Terminal 4 is the main international terminal at JFK and has delta's international flights, and other airlienas inlcluding SWISS and Virgin Atlantic. The terminal is large and modern, but the gates are very spread out so prepare to do some walking! Terminal 5 is jetblue's terminal that also plays host to aer lingus and Hawaiian. It's one of JFK's biggest and newest terminals and each gate is very close to the center of the terminal. Checking in here can be a pain, becuase of the large amount of passangers and the small amount of kiosks. Terminal 7 is British Airways' main terminal and also hosts airlinees such as cathay pacific. The terminal is one of JFK's oldest and smallest. Check and security is relaitvely painless but there is not much to look foward to after that. Terminal 8 is American airlines main terminal and other one-world allinace members such as qatar also are at terminal 8. It is modern, but the terminal is spread out and unserground walkway to most gates means you will be wlaking a lot.</p>

								<h3>Design & Food</h3>
							</header>
							<p>JFK has many great food and beverage options for travellers. It may not be on the same level as a an aiport like SFO but it has a solid selection. The design of the aiport is a circle which allows anybody to take the monorail and reach each terminal easily. </p>
